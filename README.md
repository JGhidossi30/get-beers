Problem Below:

Go to https://punkapi.com/documentation/v2 and read the documentation regarding their API. Design a simple app that consumes the "Get Beers" endpoint and exposes a UI that enables a user to view a list of all the beers and click on one to view it in detail.

Here is a list of requirements:

- Display a list of all the beers.

- If a user selects a beer, present them a detail page.

- Add functionality that allows a user to "favourite" a beer.  This should only be done in memory and should reset if the browser is refreshed.

- If a user "favourites" a beer, add it to another list that keeps track of his/her favourites.

- The favourites list should include functionality to remove a beer from the list.

Things to keep in mind:

- React is preferred.

- The app doesn't need to look super refined, as long as it is user friendly.

- We are looking for good principles of accessibility, performance, architecture, etc.

- Create a new public Github repo for this assignment.
